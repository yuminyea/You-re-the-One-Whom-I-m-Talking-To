# You’re the One Whom I’m Talking To: The Role of Contextual External Human-Machine Interfaces in Multi-Road User Conflict Scenarios

This repository accompanies the IMWUT 2025 February submission (ID: 1102). It serves to support the review process by providing documentation and illustrative materials related to the study. Full Unity packages, source code, and additional resources will be made available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

## Abstract
This study investigates the role of contextual external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) in autonomous vehicles (AVs) for resolving multi-road user conflict scenarios. Using VR-based multi-agent simulations, we evaluate how AVs can effectively communicate with pedestrians, cyclists, and manual vehicle drivers in shared traffic environments.

## Getting Started

### Pre-Built Executables
1. Download the appropriate executable from the `Builds/` folder.
2. Start the server executable first.
3. Run the respective client executable (Pedestrian, Cyclist, Driver).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to the server.
