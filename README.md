## Abstract
This study explores the role of contextual external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) in autonomous vehicles (AVs) for resolving multi-road user conflict scenarios. Using VR-based simulations, we evaluate how AVs can effectively communicate with pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers in shared traffic environments.

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Pre-Built Executables
1. Download the appropriate executable from the `Builds/` folder.
2. Start the server executable first.
3. Run the respective client executable (Pedestrian, Cyclist, Driver).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to the server.

### Option 2: Unity Package
1. Download the scripts from the `Scripts/` folder.
2. Import them into a Unity 2021.3 or later project.
3. Configure the Unity Mirror network settings for server-client communication.
